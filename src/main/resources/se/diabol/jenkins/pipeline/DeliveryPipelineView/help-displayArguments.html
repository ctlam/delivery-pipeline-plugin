    Define the additional values that can be found somewhere along the pipeline that you would like to display.<br/>
    You must pass in a valid JSON for this to work.<br/>
    You can validate your JSON at <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">http://jsonlint.com/</a><br/>
    This will eventually support reading JSON from SCM -- however that day has not yet come.<br/>
    <br/>
<pre>
{
    "The pipeline project name": {
        "The display value": {
            "projectName": "some project name",
            "filePath": "file path relative to the workspace",
            "artifactName": "the name of the artifact",
            "envName": "the name of an environment variable",
            "paramName": "the name of a parameter",
            "grepPattern": "a regex expression -- see notes below",
            "grepFlag": "the regexp flag",
            "flattenValue": "boolean value of true or false"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Additional Notes:<br/>
- The pipeline project name is the name of the first job in your pipeline.<br/>
- The display value is simply a header.<br/><br/>
- Only specify one of {filePath | artifactName | envName | paramName}.<br/>
- flattenValue and grepPattern are used in conjunction with filePath and artifactName and are OPTIONAL.<br/>
- For example, if you want to track an artifact, specify artifactName.<br/><br/>
- For filePath and artifactName, it will display a link to the file in question if flattenValue is not specified to be true.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When hovered over, it will display the full contents of the file, unless a grepPattern was specified to look for something specific.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If flattenValue is set to true, the value will be displayed as is retrieved, which means this is not ideal for large multiline files.<br/><br/>
- The grepPattern can be enclosed in forward slashes or without. e.g. "/some regexp here/" or "some regexp here"<br/>
- However, ALL BACKSLASHES '\' MUST BE ESCAPED -- use double backslashes for every backslash<br/>
- For example, if your regexp is [\w\s]+ , specify "[\\w\\s]+" as the grepPattern.<br/><br/>
Example of usage:
</p>

<pre>
{
    "SOME_PROJECT_NAME": {
        "Executor Number": {
            "projectName": "test-project",
            "envName": "EXECUTOR_NUMBER",
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
may result in:

<pre>
Executor Number: 5
