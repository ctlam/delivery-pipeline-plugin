<div>
    Define the additional values that can be found somewhere along the pipeline that you would like to display.<br/>
    You must pass in a valid JSON/YAML for this to work.<br/>
    By default, YAML parser will be used. Please uncheck "Use YAML Parser for Display Arguments" if you prefer to use JSON.
    You can validate your JSON at <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">http://jsonlint.com/</a><br/>
    This will eventually support reading JSON/YAML from SCM -- however that day has not yet come.<br/>
    <br/>
<pre>
The pipeline project name:
    Global:
        The display value:
            projectName: some project name
            filePath: file path relative to the workspace
            artifactName: the name of the artifact
            envName: the name of an environment variable
            paramName: the name of a parameter
            fromConsole: boolean value of true or false
            grepPattern: a regex expression -- see notes below
            grepFlag: the regexp flag
            useLink: boolean value of true or false
    Project_1:
        The display value:
            filePath: file path relative to the workspace
    Project_2:
        The display value:
            envName: the name of an environment variable
</pre>

<p>
Additional Notes:<br/>
- The pipeline project name is the name of the first job in your pipeline.<br/>
- Any arguments under "Global" will be displayed at the top of every build run.
- Any arguments titled a specific project name will be displayed when hovering over the project's status icon in the pipeline.
- The display value is simply a header.<br/><br/>
- Only specify one of { filePath | artifactName | envName | paramName | fromConsole }.<br/>
- useLink is used in conjunction with { filePath | artifactName } and is OPTIONAL.<br/>
- grepPattern is used to search for a specific pattern and SHOULD be used when using fromConsole. Otherwise the full console output will be shown in the table...<br/>
- For example, if you want to track an artifact, specify artifactName.<br/><br/>
- For { filePath | artifactName }, the contents of the file will be displayed unless useLink is set to true.<br/>
- If useLink is set to true, then a link to the file in question will be shown and when hovered over, it will display the contents of the file.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the link is hovered over, it will show the full contents of the file, unless a grepPattern was specified to look for something specific.<br/><br/>
- The grepPattern must be a proper regexp and does not need to be modified for YAML.<br/>
- However, IF YOU ARE USING JSON, ALL BACKSLASHES '\' MUST BE ESCAPED -- use two backslashes for every backslash<br/>
- For example, if your regexp is [\w\s]+ , specify "[\\w\\s]+" as the grepPattern.<br/><br/>
Example of usage:

<pre>
SOME_PROJECT_NAME:
    Global:
        Executor Number:
            projectName: test-project
            envName: EXECUTOR_NUMBER
</pre>

<p>
may result in:

Executor Number: 5
